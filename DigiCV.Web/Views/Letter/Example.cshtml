                <p>Dear Sir,</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    I am writing to express my interest in the Junior Programmer position at Datasoft Ltd., as
                    advertised on bdjobs. As a recent graduate in computer science and a passionate

                    <br><br>
                    During my studies, I gained experience in various programming languages including Java, Python, and
                    C++, and I have also completed several projects that demonstrate my ability to code in a structured
                    and logical manner. Furthermore, my experience working on collaborative projects has helped me to
                    develop my communication skills and my ability to work effectively as part of a team.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition to my technical skills, I have a strong work ethic and I am committed to developing my
                    skills in order to further my career in programming. I am eager to learn new technologies and
                    programming languages and I am confident that I can make a valuable contribution to your team.
                    <br><br>
                    Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my
                    qualifications further.
                </p>
